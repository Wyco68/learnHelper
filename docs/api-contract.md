# API Contract

Loaded by `/upgrade` only. Source of truth is the route files themselves
— this doc is a map, keep it in sync when routes change.

## Next.js API routes (`app/api/`)

| Route | Method | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/tree` | GET | — | `{ folders: [{ name, lessons: [{id,slug,title,seq}] }] }` |
| `/api/folders` | POST | `{ name }` | `{ ok, folder }` — app slugifies `name` before calling vaultd |
| `/api/folders/[name]` | DELETE | — | `{ ok }` |
| `/api/lesson/[folder]/[id]` | GET | — | `{ html, title }` |
| `/api/lesson/[folder]/[id]` | DELETE | — | `{ ok }` |
| `/api/lesson/[folder]/[id]` | POST | `{ newTitle }` | `{ ok }` (rename) |

Error shape is always `{ error: string }` with a non-2xx status.

There are no auth routes. There is no lesson-generation route.
Content creation happens via Claude Code (`/generate`), not the web app.

## vaultd (Go helper, default `127.0.0.1:4321`)

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/folder` | POST | `{ name }` | creates dir + empty `index.json` if new |
| `/folder/{name}` | DELETE | — | `os.RemoveAll` on the folder |
| `/lesson` | POST | `{ folder, id, slug, title, seq, html }` | writes `{id}.html`, upserts `index.json` — used by Claude Code |
| `/lesson/{folder}/{id}` | GET | — | `{ html, title }` |
| `/lesson/{folder}/{id}` | DELETE | — | removes the `.html` file + its index entry |
| `/lesson/{folder}/{id}/rename` | POST | `{ newTitle }` | index-only update |
| `/tree` | GET | — | `{ folders: [{ name, lessons: [...] }] }` |

Every name/id arriving at vaultd is already fully resolved by the caller.
`lib/vault/helper.ts` is the only TypeScript caller of these endpoints;
don't `fetch()` vaultd from anywhere else.
