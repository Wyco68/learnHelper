# Project Specification — Notes

## 1. Purpose

Notes is a web-based lesson library. It presents clean, deeply-explained
study notes in a code-editor-style reader. Notes are written in plain high-school-level
language with technically correct terminology, aimed at an Information Systems &
Network Engineering program.

**Content creation happens entirely outside the web application.**
Claude Code (the CLI) is the author. The Next.js app is the reader.

---

## 2. Architecture

Two layers, each with a single non-overlapping responsibility, packaged
inside a thin desktop shell (Tauri — see [docs/desktop.md](docs/desktop.md)).
The shell only starts/stops the other two and shows the window; it holds no
business logic and isn't a third layer in the sense below.

### 2.1 Next.js application — read and manage

- Application UI (sidebar, lesson reader, modals)
- Folder management (create, rename, delete, list)
- Lesson management (rename, delete, list)
- Browsing and navigation
- Rendering lessons (HTML parsed into React via `HtmlRenderer`)
- Mermaid diagram rendering, syntax highlighting

The Next.js app **never** generates lesson content. It **never** calls Claude.
It **never** contains AI-generation logic.

### 2.2 Go helper (`vaultd`) — filesystem operations only

A small Go HTTP service exposing exactly six operations:

```
CreateFolder()
LoadLesson()
DeleteLesson()
RenameLesson()
ListTree()
DeleteFolder()
```

It receives fully-resolved names and paths and performs raw filesystem I/O.
It contains no slugify logic, no sequence-number generation, no content logic.

---

## 3. Claude Code — content creation (outside the app)

Claude Code is the sole author of lesson content.

**Responsibilities:**
- Read uploaded lecture files (slides, PDFs, images)
- Generate lesson HTML following the output contract
- Regenerate and improve existing lessons
- Save lesson files directly to `vault/`
- Maintain `index.json` for each folder

**How Claude Code saves a lesson:**

```
/lect
  → Claude reads uploaded file
  → Claude generates semantic HTML
  → Claude writes vault/<Folder>/<id>.html
  → Claude upserts vault/<Folder>/index.json
  → Done — app refreshes on next load
```

Claude Code writes files using its own file tools. It does not go through any
Next.js API route to create content. The Go helper (`vaultd`) is still the
correct path for the app's management operations (delete, rename, list), but
Claude Code writes lesson files directly.

Claude must never:
- choose app-level folder names without following the slug format
- generate filesystem paths inconsistent with the storage model below
- write anything to `app/`, `components/`, or `lib/`

Claude returns **semantic HTML only** — never Markdown, never a file.
Allowed tags: `h1 h2 h3 p ul ol li table thead tbody tr td th pre code blockquote
strong em div class="mermaid"`. No inline styles, no `<style>`/`<script>`,
no custom classes other than `class="mermaid"`.

---

## 4. Storage model

```
vault/
  <folder-slug>/
    index.json              -- ordered lesson index for this folder
    01-topic-slug.html      -- one lesson's generated HTML
    02-another-topic.html
```

`index.json` shape:
```json
[{ "id": "01-topic-slug", "slug": "topic-slug", "title": "Topic", "seq": 1 }]
```

- `id` = `<seq padded to 2 digits>-<slug>`, e.g. `"01-introduction"`
- `slug` = lowercased, non-alphanumerics collapsed to `-`, leading/trailing `-` trimmed
- `seq` = 1-based integer, monotonically increasing within the folder

The `.html` file holds exactly the generated HTML. The app reads it verbatim.
Gitignored and portable — never committed.

---

## 5. UI

### Sidebar

```
Notes

Subjects             [+]
  <Folder 1>
  <Folder 2>
  ...
```

Clicking **+** opens a small modal with exactly one field:

```
Folder Name
[Create]
```

There is no Upload button. There is no Generate button. There is no auth UI.

---

## 6. Viewing flow

```
browser -> GET /vault
   -> AppShell renders sidebar + content pane
   -> Sidebar calls GET /api/tree
        -> Next.js calls vaultd ListTree()
        -> returns folders + lessons JSON (from each index.json)
   -> user clicks a lesson
   -> LessonViewer calls GET /api/lesson/<Folder>/<id>
        -> Next.js calls vaultd LoadLesson(folder, id)
        -> returns the stored HTML
   -> HtmlRenderer parses HTML into React elements
        (DOMParser walk — no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
        blockquote callouts → <Callout>, div.mermaid → <Mermaid>
   -> Framer Motion animates the content swap
```

---

## 7. Go helper — interface

Runs on `localhost:4321`. Next.js API routes call it via `fetch` through
`lib/vault/helper.ts` only.

| Method | Path | Body in | Body out |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `POST` | `/folder` | `{ name }` | `{ ok }` |
| `DELETE` | `/folder/:name` | — | `{ ok }` |
| `GET` | `/lesson/:folder/:id` | — | `{ html, title }` |
| `DELETE` | `/lesson/:folder/:id` | — | `{ ok }` |
| `POST` | `/lesson/:folder/:id/rename` | `{ newTitle }` | `{ ok }` |
| `GET` | `/tree` | — | `{ folders: [{ name, lessons: [...] }] }` |

Note: `POST /lesson` (save) is still implemented in vaultd and is used by
Claude Code (`/lect`) when it chooses to route through vaultd instead of
writing files directly.

## 8. Tech stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Routing, UI, API route handlers |
| Language | TypeScript | All web code; strict mode |
| UI | React 18 | Sidebar, modals, lesson viewer |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + `@tailwindcss/typography` | Dark code-editor look |
| Lesson rendering | `HtmlRenderer` (DOMParser walk) | HTML → React, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML |
| Code highlighting | `highlight.js` (client-side) | Syntax inside `<pre><code>` blocks |
| Diagrams | `mermaid` | Client-side SVG from `div.mermaid` blocks |
| Animation | `framer-motion` | Fade/slide on lesson switch |
| Filesystem helper | Go HTTP service (`vaultd`) | Folder/lesson CRUD + tree listing |
| Notes storage | `.html` + `index.json` under `vault/` | Source of truth; gitignored |
| Desktop shell | Tauri (Rust) | Native window, startup orchestration, splash screen, packaging |

No AI SDK. No authentication. No upload handling. No streaming.

## 9. Setup and running

Requires:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ and npm.
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.21+ (only to build the filesystem helper).
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) + the platform C/C++ build
  tools Tauri needs (only to build/run the desktop shell).
- A Claude subscription (Pro/Max) and the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
  CLI, used to run the `/lect` note-writing command.

```bash
npm install
```

**Desktop app (recommended)** — see [docs/desktop.md](docs/desktop.md) for
full detail:

```bash
npm run dev:desktop     # development: native window, hot reload
npm run build:desktop   # production: installer under desktop/target/release/bundle
```

**Browser-only fallback** — two manually-started processes, no native
window:

```bash
cd tools/vaultd && go build -o vaultd.exe . && cd ../..   # macOS/Linux: vaultd (no .exe)
./tools/vaultd/vaultd.exe   # filesystem helper, default :4321
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000 -> /vault
```

Writing a note happens separately, via Claude Code in a terminal, using the
`/lect` command (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)) — not through the website.

## 10. Out of scope

- No database (filesystem via Go helper is the store).
- No deployment/hosting beyond local dev.
- No multi-tenancy.
- No user authentication of any kind.
- No lesson generation inside the application.
